# Roll-the-dice
>A simple webapp to find a winner using 2 dice.

## Rules:
- Two dice are rolled end based on the higher value a winner is decided who ever gets the highest value.
- If both get same result then its a draw.

### It is just a super mini project to test my JS (DOM Manipulation) skils.
